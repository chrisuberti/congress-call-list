        title: "Halt Military Aid Being Used to Attack Iran",
        content: `Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a constituent from [YOUR CITY/STATE]. I'm calling to demand that [Senator/Representative NAME] immediately halt all military aid being used by Israel to attack Iran without Congressional authorization.

The current situation is extremely dangerous:
• Israel is using US-supplied weapons to launch strikes against Iran
• This is happening without any Congressional debate or authorization
• American military aid is being used to start a conflict that could drag the US into war
• Congress never authorized US weapons to be used for attacks on Iran
• This violates Congressional oversight of military aid and foreign policy

Why this is a Constitutional crisis:
• Congress has the power to declare war and authorize military action
• Military aid comes with restrictions on use that are being violated
• Providing weapons for unauthorized attacks makes the US complicit in starting wars
• This sets a dangerous precedent for allies dragging America into conflicts
• The President cannot commit America to war through proxy weapon supplies

Immediate actions Congress must take:
• Suspend all military aid to Israel until attacks on Iran cease
• Hold emergency hearings on unauthorized use of US weapons
• Pass binding legislation restricting use of US weapons against Iran
• Demand full accounting of which US weapons have been used in strikes
• Assert Congressional authority over military aid and foreign commitments

Historical precedent supports Congressional action:
• The Leahy Law restricts military aid when human rights violations occur
• Previous Congresses have suspended aid when allies acted against US interests
• The Arms Export Control Act requires Congressional notification for major arms transfers
• War Powers Resolution requires Congressional authorization for military commitments
• Congress has constitutional duty to control military commitments and war authorization

The dangers of continued military aid include:
• Iran will retaliate against US forces in the region
• Regional war could spread to involve multiple countries
• American service members become targets without Congressional approval
• Oil markets and global economy face massive disruption
• Nuclear weapons development could accelerate as countries feel threatened

Congress must act immediately because:
• Each day of delay allows more strikes and escalation
• Once full-scale war begins, it becomes much harder to stop
• American lives are at increasing risk with every day of inaction
• International law and Constitutional governance are being violated
• The window for peaceful resolution is rapidly closing

I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
• Immediately call for suspension of military aid being used against Iran
• Support Congressional resolutions requiring authorization for military support
• Hold emergency hearings on unauthorized use of US weapons
• Vote against any aid packages that could be used for attacks on Iran
• Publicly oppose allowing allies to drag America into unauthorized wars

What immediate action will [Senator/Representative NAME] take to halt US military support for attacks on Iran and assert Congressional war powers?

This cannot wait. Congress must act NOW before this escalates into a full war that America never authorized.

Thank you.`

    congressional: {
        title: "Require Congressional Authorization for Military Support",
        content: `Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a constituent from [YOUR CITY/STATE]. I'm calling to demand that [Senator/Representative NAME] assert Congressional war powers and require explicit authorization before any US military support for attacks on Iran.

The Constitution is being violated:
• Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the exclusive power to declare war
• Military support for attacks on other countries requires Congressional approval
• The President cannot authorize proxy wars through military aid without legislative consent
• Congress has the power and duty to prevent unauthorized military commitments
• Separation of powers is fundamental to preventing executive war-making

Current violations of Congressional authority:
• US weapons are being used to attack Iran without Congressional authorization
• Military aid is being used for purposes Congress never approved
• American forces are being positioned for potential involvement without legislative debate
• War Powers Resolution is being circumvented through proxy military action
• Congress is being bypassed in decisions that could lead to war

Why Congressional authorization is required:
• Military support for attacks on other nations constitutes act of war
• Providing weapons for strikes makes the US a co-belligerent under international law
• Congress must approve any military commitments that risk American lives
• Legislative oversight prevents reckless military adventures
• Democratic governance requires public debate before military action

Historical Constitutional precedent:
• Founding Fathers specifically feared executives starting wars without Congressional approval
• Even Presidents Washington and Jefferson sought Congressional authorization for military action
• War Powers Resolution of 1973 reinforced Congressional authority over military commitments
• Supreme Court cases have upheld Congressional power over military commitments abroad
• Previous Congresses have successfully asserted authority over military aid and foreign policy

Immediate Congressional actions needed:
• Pass binding resolution requiring authorization for any military support against Iran
• Hold emergency hearings on Constitutional violations in current policy
• Assert legislative authority over military aid and foreign commitments
• Demand full briefing on military positioning and potential US involvement
• Vote on formal authorization before any further military support

Consequences of failing to act:
• Executive branch will assume unlimited power to start wars through proxies
• Constitutional separation of powers will be permanently weakened
• Future Presidents will bypass Congress for all military commitments
• American democracy will be damaged by unchecked executive war powers
• Congress will become irrelevant in life-and-death decisions about war and peace

What Congress must do immediately:
• Assert Constitutional authority over war powers and military commitments
• Require recorded vote before any military support for attacks on Iran
• Hold public hearings on executive branch overreach in military policy
• Pass legislation restricting unauthorized use of military aid for attacks
• Ensure full Congressional debate before America becomes involved in Middle East war

I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
• Publicly demand Congressional authorization before any military support for Iran attacks
• Support legislation reasserting Congressional war powers
• Vote against any military aid that could be used without Congressional approval
• Hold emergency hearings on Constitutional violations in current policy
• Take immediate action to prevent unauthorized war escalation

The Constitution is not optional. Congress has a duty to the American people to prevent unauthorized wars and assert legislative authority over military commitments.

What specific action will [Senator/Representative NAME] take TODAY to assert Congressional war powers and require authorization for military support against Iran?

Our democracy depends on Congress fulfilling its Constitutional responsibilities.

Thank you.`

    protection: {
        title: "Protect American Lives from Retaliation",
        content: `Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a constituent from [YOUR CITY/STATE]. I'm calling to express grave concern that American service members and civilians are being put at risk by Israeli strikes using US weapons, without Congress ever authorizing such risk to American lives.

Americans are now targets because of unauthorized military support:
• US military personnel throughout the Middle East face Iranian retaliation
• American civilians working in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Gulf states are at increased risk
• US naval forces in the Persian Gulf could be attacked by Iranian missiles
• American diplomatic facilities are vulnerable to proxy attacks
• Military families are being exposed to combat risk without Congressional approval

Specific threats to American lives:
• Iranian ballistic missiles capable of reaching all US bases in the region
• Proxy forces in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen could target Americans
• Naval mines and anti-ship missiles threatening US ships in Persian Gulf
• Cyber attacks on US military and civilian infrastructure
• Kidnapping and hostage-taking of American civilians throughout the region

Why Americans are at risk without authorization:
• Israeli strikes using US weapons make America complicit in the attacks
• Iran views US military support as direct involvement in the conflict
• American forces are positioned as targets without Congressional approval for such risk
• Military families are bearing costs of foreign policy decisions they never authorized
• No exit strategy exists to protect Americans if full-scale war erupts

Historical precedents show the dangers:
• 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 American service members
• USS Cole attack demonstrated vulnerability of US naval forces to regional threats
• Embassy attacks throughout the region have repeatedly targeted American civilians
• Proxy wars often result in American casualties without clear military objectives
• Military positioning without Congressional authorization leads to mission creep and escalation

Iran's retaliation capabilities directly threaten Americans:
• Precision ballistic missile arsenal that can hit US bases across the region
• Naval capabilities to attack US ships and disrupt military operations
• Established proxy networks in multiple countries with anti-American objectives
• Advanced cyber warfare capabilities targeting US military and civilian infrastructure
• Asymmetric warfare tactics specifically designed to inflict maximum American casualties

Congress must protect Americans by:
• Demanding immediate withdrawal of US forces from potential Iranian retaliation zones
• Prohibiting use of US military equipment that makes Americans targets for retaliation
• Requiring Congressional authorization before positioning Americans at risk of foreign attack
• Establishing clear rules of engagement that prioritize protection of American lives
• Creating immediate evacuation plans for American civilians in the region

Why Congressional action is urgent:
• Each day of Israeli strikes increases risk of Iranian retaliation against Americans
• Once Americans are killed in retaliation, political pressure for war becomes enormous
• Military escalation happens faster than Congressional oversight can respond
• Protecting American lives requires immediate action, not prolonged debate
• Prevention is much easier than extraction once Americans are under attack

I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
• Immediately call for protection of American service members and civilians in the region
• Demand Congressional vote before any military positioning that puts Americans at risk
• Support legislation requiring withdrawal from unauthorized potential combat zones
• Hold emergency hearings on threats to Americans from Israeli-Iranian escalation
• Prioritize American lives over foreign military objectives and alliance commitments

American families should not pay the price for military adventures they never approved. Our service members and civilians deserve better than being used as human shields for someone else's conflict.

Congress has a duty to protect American lives and should not allow them to be put at risk without explicit authorization and full debate about the consequences.

What immediate action will [Senator/Representative NAME] take to protect Americans from the dangers of this escalating conflict?

Please act now before American lives are lost in an unauthorized war.

Thank you.`

    diplomacy: {
        title: "Support Immediate Diplomatic De-escalation",
        content: `Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a constituent from [YOUR CITY/STATE]. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to support immediate diplomatic intervention to stop the escalating military strikes between Israel and Iran before they spiral into regional war.

The current military escalation must be stopped:
• Each Israeli strike increases pressure for Iranian counter-strikes
• Military action creates cycles of retaliation that are difficult to control
• Diplomatic windows close rapidly once military confrontation begins
• Regional allies are being forced to choose sides, fracturing partnerships  
• The risk of miscalculation leading to full-scale war increases with every strike

Immediate diplomatic actions Congress can support:
• Call for UN Security Council emergency session on Israel-Iran strikes
• Support ceasefire resolutions and international mediation efforts
• Work with European allies to restart multilateral diplomatic engagement
• Engage regional partners like Qatar, Turkey, and Oman in de-escalation efforts
• Use economic incentives rather than military threats to influence behavior

Why diplomacy is more effective than military action:
• Negotiations can address underlying causes of conflict, not just symptoms
• Diplomatic solutions create lasting stability rather than temporary military dominance
• International cooperation leverages more pressure than unilateral military action
• Peace agreements benefit regional economies and American business interests
• Diplomatic engagement strengthens moderate voices in both Israel and Iran

The costs of continued military escalation:
• Regional war involving multiple countries and proxy forces
• Massive civilian casualties creating humanitarian crisis and refugee flows
• Global economic disruption from energy market chaos and supply chain breakdown
• Strengthening of hardliners in Iran who oppose diplomatic engagement
• Long-term Middle East instability affecting US interests for decades

Historical examples show diplomacy works:
• Cuban Missile Crisis resolved through negotiation, preventing nuclear war
• Camp David Accords achieved lasting peace between former enemies Egypt and Israel
• Good Friday Agreement ended decades of violent conflict through patient dialogue
• Oslo Accords demonstrated that even seemingly impossible negotiations can make progress
• The 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal proved diplomatic engagement can limit nuclear programs

Current opportunities for diplomatic engagement:
• Both Israel and Iran have domestic constituencies that prefer peace to war
• Regional allies want stability and are willing to support mediation efforts
• International community is united in opposing military escalation
• Economic pressures on both countries create incentives for negotiated solutions
• Climate change and regional challenges require cooperation rather than confrontation

What Congress can do to promote diplomacy:
• Pass resolutions calling for immediate ceasefire and international mediation
• Hold hearings on diplomatic alternatives to military escalation
• Support funding for international mediation and peace-building efforts
• Work with allies to coordinate diplomatic pressure for de-escalation
• Ensure any US involvement prioritizes diplomatic solutions over military action

Benefits of diplomatic de-escalation:
• Reduced risk to American military personnel and civilians in the region
• Economic stability and lower energy prices for American consumers
• Preserved relationships with regional allies who want peace not war
• Prevention of nuclear weapons development acceleration by threatened countries
• Strengthened international law and institutions that benefit American interests

I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
• Publicly call for immediate ceasefire between Israel and Iran
• Support UN and international mediation efforts through Congressional resolutions
• Oppose any US military involvement that escalates rather than de-escalates conflict
• Advocate for renewed multilateral diplomatic engagement with Iran
• Work with allies to provide diplomatic alternatives to continued military strikes

Military action has already begun, but it's not too late for Congress to choose diplomacy over war. Leadership means pursuing the harder path of negotiation rather than the easier path of military escalation.

What immediate steps will [Senator/Representative NAME] take to promote ceasefire and diplomatic de-escalation instead of military involvement?

Time is running out. Please choose diplomacy before this becomes an irreversible regional war.

Thank you.`
